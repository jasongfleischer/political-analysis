This repo contains a few random ideas I had trying to analyze data related to politics.

_Flip Wyoming blue_ contains an analysis of just how few people it would take to remake the least populous state in the union into a reliable two Senate votes for the Dems. The numbers required are easily within the number of people who migrate among states normally, you'd just have to build a movement of people doing it to Wyoming in particular.  In a time when many young urban voters are both liberal and priced out of big city life, and in an era of telecommuting, this is a time when it might actually be possible to put together this kind of movement.

_Population of senate seats_ shows that indeed there is a weird feature of our system, that < 20% of the population will control > 50% of the votes. Thus it seems like a good idea of the less rural party to do stuff like the Flip Wyoming project.
