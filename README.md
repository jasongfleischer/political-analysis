This repo contains a few random ideas I had trying to analyze data related to politics.

_Population of senate seats_ shows that indeed there is a weird feature of our system, that < 20% of the population will control > 50% of the votes. Thus the less rural party might want to do stuff like the Flip Wyoming project.

_Flip Wyoming blue_ it would only take 50k - 70k reliable voting Democrats moving to WY to remake the least populous state into a reliable two Senate votes for the Dems. The numbers required are easily within the number of people who migrate among states normally. A quick search shows that about 10 states have annual migrations of greater than 50k people, including the neighboring state of Colorado.  You'd just have to build a movement of liberal people moving to Wyoming in particular.  This seems reasonable to do when demographic forces are on your side:

- WY is cheap
- Many young urban voters are both liberal and priced out of big city life
- Telecommuting is easy
- Many people want to live active outdoor lifestyles. CO certainly sells that.  And WY is definitely a great place for it.
